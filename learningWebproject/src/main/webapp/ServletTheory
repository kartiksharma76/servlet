RequestDispatcher-
it is an interface available in javax.servlet package.
it has below methods-
a) forword()
b) include()

-forword() method-
if you want to forword the request {HttpServletRequest} from servlet to Html/jsp/servlet


-include() method-
if you want to include some resources {jsp / html/servlet} then used include() method

Difference between include() and forword() methods?

forword() method : you can place many forword method in 1 sevlet conditionaly to
forword to control but only 1 forword() will be executed

include() method:you can place many include methods in servlet and all include methods will be executed


--NOTE--
you can restrict the user from accessing the resource(html/jsp) by placing the page under WEB-INF folder/directory
